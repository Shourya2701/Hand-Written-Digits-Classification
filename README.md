# Hand-Written-Digits-Classification
By this project one will be able to predict digits from hand-written images with a high degree of accuracy and along the way, you will develop a basic understanding of how Neural Networks work and you will also develop a basic understanding of TensorFlow syntax with Keras as its front end.
